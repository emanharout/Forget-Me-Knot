# Forget-Me-Knot

A project I did within an 11 hour constraint. Server no longer active, but I put this up anyway to demonstrate clean, interative code written with a time constraint.

There are a few things that can be improved, but I thought I would leave it as is since it shows what I can do within 10 hours.
